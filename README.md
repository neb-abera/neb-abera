I am a Software Engineer from Chicago. I am an avid reader, and I love learning how to solve problems that require an interdisciplinary approach. If you have any book recommendations please send them my way! I am currently working on projects in JavaScript and C++. 

If you're a servicemember thinking about programming, but don't know how to program, here's [Everything I Learned Transitioning From the Army to Software Development](https://github.com/nebyou-abera/transition)

If you're a servicemember considering leaving active duty, take a look at [The Military Transition Guide I Wish I Had](https://www.sutori.com/en/story/the-military-transition-guide-i-wish-i-had--neKEiwGvCVS7veAei58G9TUT).
