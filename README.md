Hi, Iâ€™m @nebyou-abera

I am currently doing a career pivot to Software Development in Chicago. 

I am an avid reader, and I love learning how to solve problems that require an interdisciplinary approach. If you have any book recommendations, please send them my way! I am currently working on projects in JavaScript, Python, and C++. I would describe myself as disciplined, team oriented, and purpose driven. I also enjoy organizing, planning, and optimizing things. I don't make too many moves in life without thorough analysis, and producing deliberate planning products.

I am an avid virtual reality enthusiast and in my free time, I like to build computers and mod games. Some folks like to build "muscle cars" but only drive them to work and back; I like to build "muscle computers" that I don't even play video games on. I've come to realize that I have more fun building and tinkering with software than using it for its intended use. I also dedicate my free time to Mixed Martial Arts, mostly Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Judo.
