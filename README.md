I am a Software Engineer from Chicago. I am an avid reader, and I love learning how to solve problems that require an interdisciplinary approach. If you have any book recommendations please send them my way! I am currently working on projects in C++, Typescript, C# using .NET, and Python. 

If you're a servicemember thinking about programming, but don't know how to program, here's [Everything I Learned Transitioning From the Army to Software Development](https://github.com/neb-abera/transition)

If you're a servicemember considering leaving active duty, take a look at [The Military Transition Guide I Wish I Had](https://abera.tech/transition).
