Hi, Iâ€™m @nebyou-abera

I am a Software Developer from Chicago. If you're a servicemember considering leaving active duty, take a look at [The Military Transition Guide I Wish I Had](https://www.sutori.com/en/story/the-military-transition-guide-i-wish-i-had--neKEiwGvCVS7veAei58G9TUT). If you're a servicemember thinking about programming, but don't know how to program, here's [Everything I Learned Transitioning Trying to Transition From the Army to Software Development](https://github.com/nebyou-abera/transition)

I am an avid reader, and I love learning how to solve problems that require an interdisciplinary approach. If you have any book recommendations please send them my way! I am currently working on projects in JavaScript and C++. 

I would describe myself as disciplined, team oriented, and purpose driven. I also enjoy organizing, planning, and optimizing things. I don't make too many moves in life without thorough analysis, and producing deliberate planning products. For example, below is the result of me asking myself "what should I read for professional development."
